        <p class="am-text">Hello, my name is Iris Hernandez, just in case you didn't catch that on the home page. Here's a bit about who I am. I live in Dallas, Tx, and practically grew up here as well. I speak three languages: English, Spanish, Portuguese, and I would love to learn another. I am a dog lover which is why I have a beloved dog named Kirby. I am also a fan of matcha lattes, it is one of my favorite drinks. I pretty much make it a goal to try at least one at every coffee shop I visit.
Growing up I honestly didn't know what I wanted to take up as a career. But the closer the time came to choose, the more I knew I wanted to do something that had to do with technology, because it seems like technological advancements happen everyday! Various friends of mine and even family members mentioned the idea of becoming a web developer, so I thought I'd give it a shot and I enrolled in a Front-End Web Development Course. The more I learned, the more I became amazed and enjoyed programming. I am a very detail-oriented person and seeing how detailed web development was, it was a perfect fit. Now here I am ready to offer my services to help others build a website that will help them succeed in what they do, and hopefully that will include you :)
